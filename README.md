### Lendsqr Frontend Assessmement Test 

Built a 3 page web application consisting of a login page, user page and user/[userId] page (to display information for a single user)
 
- Login page takes the user's email and password and stores the email in the local storage for auth to access the other pages, if email is not stord and user's try to access other pages they will be redirected back to the login page
- User's page this is to display a quick look at all user's information, basically a summary of each user
- User/[userId] page is used to display a single user's information gotten from the api and uses the params to get the id to fetch for just a single user
